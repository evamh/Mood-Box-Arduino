# Physical-Computing-Final-Project
Final project for physical computing

The project is a mood box which explores the relationship between sensory input and our moods, specifically lights, sounds and scents. In this project, a user chooses a mood (sleep, focus or boost) and lights, sounds and scents are emitted. The user can also change the shades of the lights.
